# Youtube_Timestamp_Generator

Demo of using LLMs to automate timestamp generation for videos

Youtube content creators currently can create their own timestamps in videos if they choose, but many videos don't have them.
This project seeks to automate this process with the use of text transcription and large language model post processing.
This tool looks to help users quickly find what they are searching for in a given video.
